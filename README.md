# Dear future students
I get it, you may be stuck in the assignment that professor helal posted. Take inspiration, yes, but please don't copy the code. Trust me, you will get into a lot of trouble if caught. UF's plagiarism checkers scan your code with content from GitHub, and just canging variable names and moving functions from top to bottom will not help you. So, just don't do it. You are welcome to understand how to approach a problem and code it yourself. Professor Helal is very relaxed when it comes to grading - please don't take advantage of that.
