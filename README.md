# CNT5517
Codes for CNT 5517 Mobile Computing. This was a very rewarding course I took at the University of Florida in Fall 2021, taught by Professor Helal. This repository serves as a backup for my IoT and network code I wrote throughout the course duration.

## Navigating through the repo
The code for four laboratory assignments are placed in their respective folders. Each folder has a readme with either basic information or steps to execute the code.

## Dear future students
I get it, you may be stuck in the assignment that Professor Helal posted. Take inspiration, yes, but please don't copy the code. Trust me, you will get into a lot of trouble if caught. UF's plagiarism checkers scan your code with content from GitHub, and just changing variable names and moving functions from top to bottom will not help you. So, just don't do it. You are welcome to understand how to approach a problem and code it yourself. Professor Helal is very relaxed when it comes to grading - please don't take advantage of that.
